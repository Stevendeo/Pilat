1) Requirements

To use PILAT, we strongly recommend to install the Ocaml package manager OPAM.
To install it from debian, just execute 'sudo apt-get install opam'. Then, 
initialize OPAM by executing 'opam init --comp 4.04.1' that will install 
OCaml 4.04.1. Otherwise, check https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html to 
install OPAM.

-- With OPAM --

   The simplest. "opam install pilat". If it fails, try to update and upgrade 
   your package list with "opam install update" then "opam install upgrade".

-- Without OPAM --

   I strongly recommend you to retry installing opam. Otherwise
   
   a) Get the latest version of Ocaml (at least the 4.08.1). 
      
   b) Download the Frama-C source on http://frama-c.com/ and unzip it.
      Then go to the main directory and run : 
	autoconf
	./configure
	make depend
	make
	sudo make install

   c) Install the lapack library

   d) Install lacaml and zarith. You can find the sources in 
      http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/
      Just make sure to install the libraries at the same place than the folder
      containing "ocamlc".

   e) You can run "sh make.sh" and "sh install.sh".
      Otherwise, go to src/ and run :
	autoconf
	./configure 
	make depend
	make
	sudo make install

Run frama-c -pilat-h for the complete list of options (and to check Pilat is 
correctly installed)
